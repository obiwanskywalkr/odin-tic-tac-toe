# odin-tic-tac-toe

A basic Tic Tac Toe game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The goal with this project was to practice using factory functions, the module pattern, and to also practice keeping the global namespace clean.

On loading the page, a splash screen is displayed and players are asked for their names.

Once the game has started, hovering over cells in the grid will display the current turn.

Play continues until a win condition has been met or a draw is reached, at which point another splash screen is displayed with the results of the game.
